# Senior-Thesis

The code and data in this repository allow you to generate the options-implied risk-neutral probability density function for the JPY/USD exchange rate from January 1, 2018 to April 1, 2024.

The methodology is contained in David Shimko (April 1993), "Bounds of Probability," published in Risk Magazine, Vol. 6, No. 4. The PDF is contained in the repository.

This repository is a supplement to my forthcoming undergraduate senior thesis, "FX Options-Implied Probability Densities and Macroeconomic Surprises," submitted as partial fulfillment of the requirements for departmental honors at the Johns Hopkins University Department of Economics.
